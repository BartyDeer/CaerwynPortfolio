												Caerwyn has been passionate about games for as long as he can recall. The ability to create immersive and thought-provoking worlds that utilise uniquely interesting mechanics to capture an audience and provide them with an engaging and inspirational experience, is one that he not only admires but strives to learn and develop for himself. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Over the past several years he has focused on building a game development skillset through working on several small projects, both solo and with a team. Originally starting out with small scratch and monogame games in high school, Caerwyn eventually stumbled across the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE) in Sydney via an Ad on the side of a bus. There he began studying Animation, Modelling and Programming during the holiday courses AIE offered. After leaving high school Caerwyn knew exactly what he wanted his future career to be, and so he enrolled into the game design course at AIE and created several further projects that he has since released onto his itch.io page (https://caerwyn.itch.io/).
											</p>
											<p>
												Through these projects Caerwyn created several games that he is extremely proud of, even with their flaws. Though they may be small in scope, creating them was still an extremely fun experience where he got the pleasure to work with many inspiring teammates, and further expand upon his skillsets and knowledge of game design and the overall game development cycle. In his personal time, Caerwyn enjoys working on growing his skillsets in other areas by continuing to learn more about 3D Modelling and Animation via Blender, and Programming via solo and team-based Unity projects. Caerwyn also enjoys studying new game releases and creating design test projects like Arcade Panic (https://caerwyn.itch.io/arcade-panic). Caerwynâ€™s hope is that through the dedication he has for his he will be able to work with those who have inspired him throughout his career and create amazing experiences for many to enjoy and love just like he did.
